Description: iDEA is a new method for analyzing single-cell RNAseq
    data. It integrates differential expression (DE) analysis and gene set
    enrichment analysis (GSEA) into a joint statistical framework,
    providing substantial power gains for both analytic tasks. iDEA
    requires gene-level summary statistics in terms of fold change/effect
    size estimates and their standard errors as input, which can be
    obtained using any existing single-cell RNAseq DE methods.
